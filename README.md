## write tests for code blocks of your choice. Practice engineering optimal prompts to engage AI. Anytime you utilize AI:
### the code:
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
Now, let's write some test cases for this factorial function using the Jest testing framework:

javascript
Copy code
describe('factorial', () => {
  test('should return 1 when input is 0', () => {
    expect(factorial(0)).toBe(1);
  });

  test('should return 1 when input is 1', () => {
    expect(factorial(1)).toBe(1);
  });

  test('should return the correct factorial for positive integers', () => {
    expect(factorial(5)).toBe(120);
    expect(factorial(10)).toBe(3628800);
    expect(factorial(20)).toBe(2432902008176640000);
  });
});
In this test suite, we have three test cases:

The first test case checks if the factorial of 0 is equal to 1.
The second test case checks if the factorial of 1 is equal to 1.
The third test case verifies that the factorial function produces the correct result for various positive integers.
To run the tests, you can execute the following command:

shell
Copy code
npx jest factorial.test.js
Jest will execute the test cases and report the results, indicating whether each test passed or failed.
